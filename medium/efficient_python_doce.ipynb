    "# Comprehensive Guide on How to Write Efficient Python Code\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. However, writing efficient Python code is crucial to maximize the performance of your programs and make the best use of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Python’s Execution Model\n",
    "Python code is executed line by line, in a top-down fashion. The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mechanism used in CPython that synchronizes the execution of threads so that only one native thread executes Python bytecode at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing Efficient Python Code\n",
    "### Choosing the Right Data Structures and Algorithms\n",
    "Python offers a variety of data structures that you can use depending on the problem you’re trying to solve. The choice of data structures and algorithms has a significant impact on the efficiency of your code. For example, lists are great for small collections, but for large datasets with non-sequential access, a set or dictionary might be more efficient. Tuple are immuatable, and light weighted than list, if the when order of objects won't change, tuple is preferred. \n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right algorithm can significantly improve the performance of your program. For example, if the data is ordered, binary search would reduce the time complexity to O(log(N)) compare linear seasrch O(N). Recursive functions are often more readable than iteration, but the latter is usually more efficient because it doesn’t involve the overhead of pushing and popping frames on the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Built-in and Proven Functions and Libraries\n",
    "Python’s standard library is packed with useful built-in functions and data types. Python build-in funcitons are well written and test. Using these can result in more efficient and cleaner code. For example Using the built-in `sum()` function to add up numbers in a list is faster than manual loop. Python’s standard library also includes a variety of modules that provide additional functionalities. For example, the math module provides mathematical functions, the datetime module helps you work with dates and times, and the random module lets you generate random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the standard library, Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries that you can use. These libraries provide functionalities that go beyond the standard library. For example, numpy and pandas are great for numerical and data analysis, requests is excellent for making HTTP requests,pydantic are popular in data validation and flask and django are popular for web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose build-in and proven libraies, you leveragte the work of others, normally mean more effient, readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing Pythonic Code \n",
    "Writing “Pythonic” code means following the conventions and idioms of the Python community, resulting in code that is clear and efficient.\n",
    "- List Comprehensions\n",
    "List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists. They can be more readable and faster than traditional loops.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using a list comprehension\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in my_list]\n",
    "print(squares)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generators\n",
    "Generators are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples. They generate values on the fly, which makes them more memory-efficient than lists.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using a generator to create an iterable\n",
    "def count_up_to(n):\n",
    "    i = 1\n",
    "    while i <= n:\n",
    "        yield i\n",
    "        i += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in count_up_to(5):\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Local Variables\n",
    "Local variables are faster to access than global variables in Python. Also, using local variables can make your code cleaner and less prone to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using local variables\n",
    "def function():\n",
    "    local_var = 5  # Faster to access than a global variable\n",
    "    print(local_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Local varaialbe is also faster than dot operation. dot operation first calls __getattribute()__ or __getattr()__ which then use dictionary operation which costs time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "def function():\n",
    "  sqrt=math.sqrt\n",
    "  for i in range(100):\n",
    "    sqrt(i)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Well-Known Tricks\n",
    "- Caching\n",
    "Caching can speed up your code by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using caching to speed up a function\n",
    "from functools import lru_cache\n",
    "\n",
    "@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n",
    "def fibonacci(n):\n",
    "    if n < 2:\n",
    "        return n\n",
    "    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use multiple assignments\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a, b, c, d = 2, 3, 5, 7\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Concatenation of Strings\n",
    "When concatenating strings, it’s more efficient to use the .join() method rather than the + operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Efficient string concatenation\n",
    "my_strings = ['Hello', 'world!']\n",
    "print(' '.join(my_strings))\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Efficient Data Analysis and Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Computation Using Pandas and Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy and Pandas are powerful tools for data analysis in Python. They provide efficient, flexible, and convenient ways to manipulate, filter, and aggregate complex data, saving you time and effort compared to using standard Python data structures. Pandas and Numpy, built on C, offer efficient data computation in Python. They support vectorized operations for faster computations unlike Python’s element-wise operations. Numpy arrays and Pandas DataFrames are memory efficient, providing densely packed arrays of homogeneous type, which are more efficient than Python’s lists or dictionaries. They allow efficient data access and come with optimized built-in functions for data manipulation and analysis, outperforming custom Python code.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Data computation with pandas and numpy\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a DataFrame\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n",
    "    'B': [5, 15, 10, 20, 15],\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the mean of column B\n",
    "mean = df['B'].mean()\n",
    "print(mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Apply a function to column A\n",
    "df['A'] = df['A'].apply(np.sqrt)\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallel Computation Using Third-Party Libraries\n",
    "Third-party libraries like Dask, Ray, and Numba can be used for parallel computation, which can significantly speed up your code.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Parallel computation with Dask\n",
    "import dask.array as da\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a large array\n",
    "x = da.random.random((10000, 10000), chunks=(1000, 1000))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Do some computations\n",
    "result = x.sum().compute()\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Concurrency\n",
    "Concurrency is an essential feature in modern software development that allows programs to run multiple tasks simultaneously. Python provides several concurrency techniques, including asyncio, threading, and multiprocessing.\n",
    "### Asynio\n",
    "Python’s asyncio module utilizes coroutines and an event loop,  provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating and managing asynchronous tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Asynchronous computation with asyncio\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def main():\n",
    "    print('Hello')\n",
    "    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "    print('world!')\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Multithreading\n",
    "Threading is a technique where multiple threads of execution run within a single process. Each thread operates independently, allowing the program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n",
    "\n",
    "def task(n):\n",
    "    # io bound operation\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n",
    "    future = executor.submit(task, 5)\n",
    "    print(future.result())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiprocessing\n",
    "Multiprocessing bypasses GIL and makes use of multiple processors and cores in a machine.  For CPU-bound tasks, multiprocessing can be more efficient than multithreading due to Python’s GIL.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor\n",
    "\n",
    "def task(n):\n",
    "    #cpu bound operation \n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:\n",
    "    future = executor.submit(task, 5)\n",
    "    print(future.result())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Profiling Python Code\n",
    "Profiling is the process of measuring the time and memory usage of your code. This can help you identify bottlenecks and optimize your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Profiling Python code with cProfile\n",
    "import cProfile\n",
    "\n",
    "def slow_function():\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    for i in range(1000000):\n",
    "        total += i\n",
    "    return total\n",
    "\n",
    "cProfile.run('slow_function()')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Conclustion\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing efficient Python code is a combination of understanding Python’s execution model, choosing the right data structures and algorithms, using built-in functions and libraries, writing Pythonic code, and profiling your code to identify bottlenecks. By following these strategies, you can write Python code that is faster, more memory-efficient, and easier to read and maintain. Happy coding!"

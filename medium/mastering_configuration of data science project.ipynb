    "# Mastering the Configuration in Data Science Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration management is a critical aspect of data science projects. The separation of configuration from source code offers numerous benefits. This article will explore the importance of this practice, compare various configuration file formats, introduce the use of Pydantic BaseSettings, and provide an example of a web scraping project that employs these technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of Separating Configuration from Source Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Environment Flexibility: By separating configuration from the source code, you can easily adapt your application to different environments (development, testing, production) without changing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Security: Sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, and other secrets should not be hard-coded into the application. Keeping them in a separate configuration file allows for better security practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Maintainability and Scalability: Changes in the environment or third-party services should not require a change in the codebase. A well-structured configuration file makes it easier to update these details and scale the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison of Configuration File Formats\n",
    "Several formats are commonly used for configuration files, each with its own strengths and weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. JSON: Easy to use with JavaScript and many other languages, but lacks comments and can be verbose.\n",
    "2. YAML: More human-readable and supports comments, but the syntax can be complex and parsing is slower.\n",
    "3. INI: Simple and easy to write, but lacks standardization and advanced features.\n",
    "4. TOML: Designed to be easy to parse and write, supports complex data types, but less widely adopted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Leveraging Pydantic for Configuration Management\n",
    "Pydantic offers numerous benefits for configuration management. It provides strong typing of configuration variables, which can help catch errors early and improve code readability. Pydantic’s BaseSettings class allows for automatic parsing from environment variables and advanced validation, simplifying the process of loading and validating configurations. It also supports various file formats like JSON, YAML, and .env, offering flexibility in how configurations are stored. Furthermore, Pydantic configurations are easy to use with modern Python features like type hints and autocomplete, making the development process more efficient. Lastly, Pydantic’s clear and concise syntax helps keep configuration code clean and maintainable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Project Example: Web Scraping Financial Website\n",
    "Let’s consider a project where we scrape financial data from a website, clean the data, compute metrics, and save the data to a database. We’ll use Pydantic’s BaseSettings to manage our configuration. We will TOML configuration file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Structure\n",
    "Here is a possible structure for our project\n",
    "```\n",
    "/my_project\n",
    "|-- /src\n",
    "|   |-- __init__.py\n",
    "|   |-- main.py\n",
    "|   |-- scrape.py\n",
    "|   |-- clean.py\n",
    "|   |-- compute.py|   \n",
    "|-- /config\n",
    "|   |-- settings.toml\n",
    "|-- /tests\n",
    "|   |-- __init__.py\n",
    "|   |-- test_scrape.py\n",
    "|   |-- test_clean.py\n",
    "|   |-- test_compute.py\n",
    "|-- README.md\n",
    "|-- requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this structure, the src directory contains the source code of our project, divided into different modules (scrape.py, clean.py, compute.py, database.py). The config directory contains our configuration file, settings.toml. The tests directory contains our unit tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration File \n",
    "Here’s an example of what our settings.toml file could look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[default]\n",
    "scraping_url = \"http://example.com\"\n",
    "database_url = \"postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase\"\n",
    "metrics = [\"metric1\", \"metric2\", \"metric3\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Using Pydantic BaseSettings with TOML\n",
    "Pydantic’s BaseSettings class can be used with TOML configuration files. Here’s how you can modify our Settings class to load from our settings.toml file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseSettings, AnyHttpUrl, PostgresDsn\n",
    "from typing import List\n",
    "import toml\n",
    "\n",
    "class Settings(BaseSettings):\n",
    "    scraping_url: AnyHttpUrl\n",
    "    database_url: PostgresDsn\n",
    "    metrics: List[str]\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Config:\n",
    "        env_file = \"config/settings.toml\"\n",
    "        env_file_encoding = 'utf-8'\n",
    "\n",
    "settings = Settings()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the Config inner class tells BaseSettings to load environment variables from our settings.toml file. The env_file_encoding is set to 'utf-8' to read the file correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when you create an instance of Settings, it will automatically load the configuration from settings.toml.  In our web scraping script, we ca now use these settings\n",
    "\n",

# Top 5 Data Visualization Libraries in Python inÂ 2023
Introduction
Data visualization is an integral part of data analysis, providing insights through visual representation. Python, a leader in the data science world, offers a plethora of libraries for this purpose. In 2023, some libraries have stood out for their ease of use, comprehensive features, and robust community support. Let's explore the top 5 data visualization libraries in Python.
1. Matplotlib
Overview: Matplotlib is the grandfather of Python data visualization libraries, offering immense control over every element of a plot.
Key Features: Its versatility allows creation of simple line plots to complex 3D diagrams.
Example Code:
pythonCopy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Simple Line Plot")
plt.xlabel("X Axis")
plt.ylabel("Y Axis")
plt.show()
